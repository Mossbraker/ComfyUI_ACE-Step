# ACE-Step Nodes for ComfyUI

Fast, high-quality music generation, "repainting", remixing, editing, extending, and more.  Windows, Linux, and Mac should all be supported (not fully tested).

Added a node for lyrics language conversion to provide multilingual support for the official [ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/audio/ace-step/ace-step-v1) ACE-Step workflow. Currently, ACE-Step supports 19 languages, but the following ten languages have better support:
- English
- Chinese: [zh]
- Russian: [ru]
- Spanish: [es]
- Japanese: [ja]
- German: [de]
- French: [fr]
- Portuguese: [pt]
- Italian: [it]
- Korean: [ko]
